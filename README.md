## 📌 Abstract
Mending in the textile industry traditionally required manual labor and manual data logging. Although semi-automated machines exist, database management and record-keeping are still mostly manual.  
This project aims to **automate the data logging system** using sensors, Human Machine Interface (HMI), and IoT integration to improve efficiency, accuracy, and reduce human intervention.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Automate **fabric length measurement** using sensors.  
- Log data digitally through an HMI system.  
- Generate **real-time reports** with IoT server integration.  
- Enable **Excel-based storage** and analytics for decision-making.

## ⚙️ Proposed Methodology
1. **Data Entry**: Operator enters loom number and quality number via keypad.  
2. **Fabric Measurement**: Rotary encoder measures cloth length in meters.  
3. **Printing**: Thermal printer generates stickers with loom/quality/fabric data.  
4. **Real-time Monitoring**: Data is displayed on a web-based IoT dashboard.  
5. **Database & Reporting**: Records stored as Excel sheets for analytics and historical tracking.
